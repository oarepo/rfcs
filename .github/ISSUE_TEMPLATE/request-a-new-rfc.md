### Motivation

> Why do we need to do this? What user stories does it support? What is the expected outcome?

### Summary

> What are you proposing to change or implement (high-level overview only)?

### Resources

> What is the overall timeline and priority of implementation? Who should be involved?

> Note: Creating a new RFC is a moderated process. Your request will be reviewed by the OARepo Architects on their meetings. This is to aid scoping the RFC and avoid duplication of RFCs.
